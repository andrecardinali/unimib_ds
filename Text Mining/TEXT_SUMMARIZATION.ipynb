Fourteen of them are alleged to be top al Qaeda figures.\\nWriting for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said, \\\"the laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times. Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system reconciled within the framework of the law.\\\"\\nKennedy, the court's swing vote, was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, generally considered the liberal contingent.\\nAt issue was the rights of detainees to contest their imprisonment and challenge the rules set up to try them.  Watch how the 5-4 ruling is a major blow for the Bush administration \\u00bb\\nA congressional law passed in 2006 would limit court jurisdiction to hear so-called habeas corpus challenges to detention. It is a legal question the justices have tackled three times since 2004, including Thursday's ruling.\\nEach time, the justices have ruled against the government's claim that it has the authority to hold people it considers \\\"enemy combatants.\\\"\\nPreliminary hearings have begun in Guantanamo for some of the accused. A military panel this month arraigned five suspected senior al Qaeda detainees, including the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was transferred to the prison camp in 2006.\\nThe Bush administration has urged the high court not to get involved in the broader appeals, saying the federal judiciary has no authority to hear such matters.\\nFour justices agreed. In a sharp dissent, read in part from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority \\\"warps our Constitution.\\\"\\nThe \\\"nation will live to regret what the court has done today,\\\" Scalia said.\\nHe was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.\\nPresident Bush, who is traveling in Europe, said he disagreed with the Guantanamo ruling but promised to abide by it.\\n\\\"Congress and the administration worked very carefully on a piece of legislation that set the appropriate procedures in place as to how to deal with the detainees,\\\" he said. \\\"We'll study this opinion, and we'll do so with this in mind to determine whether or not additional legislation might be appropriate so that we can safely say, truly say to the American people, 'we are doing everything we can to protect you.' \\\"\\nThe Pentagon declined to comment, and the Justice Department said it was reviewing the decision and was expected to comment later Thursday.\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, welcomed the ruling, saying the Supreme Court upheld the Constitution.\\n\\\"I have long been an advocate of closing Guantanamo, so I would hope this is in furtherance of taking that action,\\\" Pelosi said.\\nThe appeals involve noncitizens. Sixteen lawsuits filed on behalf of about 200 prisoners were put on hold pending a ruling last year by a federal appeals court upholding the government's right to detain and prosecute suspected terrorists and war criminals.\\nAn attorney for one of the detainees, Salim Ahmed Hamdan -- Osama bin Laden's alleged driver and bodyguard -- said he would file an appeal asking that charges be dropped against the Yemeni native.\\n\\\"The clearest immediate impact of this ruling is to remove the remaining barriers for closing Guantanamo Bay. It means, in legal terms, Guantanamo Bay is no different than Kansas,\\\" attorney Charles Swift said.\\nNow the ruling has been issued, a flood of similar appeals can be expected.\\nThe lead plaintiffs are Lakhdar Boumediene, a Bosnian, and Fawzi al-Odah of Kuwait. They question the constitutionality of the Military Commissions Act, passed by Congress in October 2006. The law addresses how suspected foreign terrorists and fighters can be tried and sentenced under U.S. military law.\\nUnder the system, those facing trial would have a limited right to appeal any conviction, reducing the jurisdiction of federal courts.\\nThe suspects also must prove to a three-person panel of military officers they are not a terror risk. But defendants would have access to evidence normally given to a jury, and CIA agents were given more guidance in how far they can go in interrogating prisoners.\\nThe law was a direct response to a June 2006 Supreme Court ruling striking down the Bush administration's plan to try detainees before military commissions.\\nIn 2004, the justices also affirmed the right of prisoners to challenge their detention in federal court. Congress and the administration have sought to restrict such access.\\nThe Justice Department wanted the high court to pass on these appeals, at least until the first wave of tribunals had a chance to work. Administration officials also argued the prisoners have plenty of legal safeguards.\\nThe White House has said it is considering whether to close the Guantanamo prison, suggesting some high-level al Qaeda detainees could be transferred to the federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, and to a military brig in North Charleston, South Carolina.\\nMost of the dozens of pending cases have been handled in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, which in February 2007 upheld the Military Commissions Act's provision stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear \\\"habeas\\\" challenges to the prisoners' confinement.\\nBut a three-judge panel of the same circuit expressed concern about why the U.S. military continues to limit attorney access to the Guantanamo men.\\nThe detainees' legal team alleges the government is unfairly restricting access to potentially exculpatory evidence, including documents they may not know exist before pretrial hearings.\\nLegal and terrorism analysts said the issues presented in these latest sets of appeals are unlike those the justices have delved into previously.\\n\\\"The difference in this case is that they have a congressional enactment cutting back on habeas corpus that they have to wrestle with,\\\" said Edward Lazarus, a leading appellate attorney and author of a book on the high court, \\\"Closed Chambers: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court.\\\"\\n\\\"And that, from a constitutional point of view, is really a different question.\\\"\\nIn a separate decision, the court refused to intervene in the case of two American citizens convicted in Iraqi courts but held by the U.S. military.\\nThe high court rejected lawyers' arguments that Mohammad Munaf and Shawqi Ahmad Omar should be released, saying that U.S. courts are not allowed to intervene in foreign courts.\",\n          \"GLASGOW, Scotland -- Scottish Premier League leaders Celtic suffered another setback in their bid for a third successive title after being held 1-1 by managerless Hibernian on Saturday.\\nDavid Murphy's goals have earned Hibernian four points against the Auld Firm this season.\\nGordon Strachan's team head the table by three points from Glasgow rivals Rangers, who have three games in hand ahead of Sunday's trip to Aberdeen.\\nVisiting Hibernian, whose manager John Collins surprisingly resigned on Thursday citing a lack of financial backing from the Edinburgh side's board, took the lead in the 20th minute through left-back David Murphy.\\nThe Englishman played a one-two with Abdessalam Benjelloun before crashing a shot from the edge of the box past goalkeeper Mark Brown and in off the crossbar.\\nMurphy's only other goal this season came in Hibs' 1-0 win at Rangers on October 6.\\nBrown did well to keep out Merouane Zemmama's audacious shot from just inside the Celtic half soon after, and also tipped over Brian Kerr's looping header three minutes after half-time.\\nSubstitute Jiri Jarosik rescued Celtic from a first home SPL defeat this season in the 78th minute after being teed up by Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, who then headed against the post with two minutes to play.\\nHibernian held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men, after Benjelloun was stretchered off with their three substitutes already used.\\nThe victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place, while Celtic have taken just six points from the last five games.\\nStrachan, who confirmed he is hoping to sign Brazilian defender Coelho next month, said: \\\"We need to cut out the silly mistakes because if you look at some of the goals we have let in away from home this season, they are silly mistakes.\\n\\\"We could have definitely done something with every one of them. I'm happy with the number of chance we've made in the last few weeks, but unhappy with individual mistakes.\\n\\\"It's not been great to look at, and we need to cut it out. We have honest lads walking in to the dressing room and saying, 'That was my fault.'\\n\\\"I said to them, 'It's very commendable lads but we can't keep doing this.' There has been a lot going right for us, but one or two things going wrong.

The rest were treated at makeshift clinics in the square, Adawi said, but hospitals expected more people to be brought in.\\nThe victims had been hit by rocks, glass bottles, birdshot and Molotov cocktails, Dr. Hisham Sheeha, another Health Ministry official, told CNN. At least a dozen gunshots rang out across the plaza, and ambulances darted in and out of the square as the fighting continued.\\nTahrir Square was the epicenter of the protests that drove Mubarak from power in February and the ongoing demonstrations against the military council that succeeded him. The state-run Middle East News Agency, citing a military source, said there were no police or troops in the square at the time.\\nWitnesses said Tuesday's melee began with fights between vendors and protesters, who began throwing rocks and attacking their kiosks with sticks. The protesters complained some vendors were giving demonstrations a bad image by selling marijuana, said Mina Hagras, one of the demonstrators who has been camped in the square.\\n\\\"This is not the spirit of the revolutionaries or the square,\\\" Hagras said. \\\"They warned them. They did not stop. So they took matters in their own hands and beat them up. Now, state TV is saying all the protesters in (the) square are thugs and drug users. This is not fair.\\\"\\nBut Mohamed Shafei, whose sandwich stand was destroyed in the brawl, said the protesters turned on the vendors indiscriminately and confiscating their goods.\\n\\\"Yes, there were several vendors selling hashish and pills, but not all of us are the same,\\\" Shafei said as he carried the remains of his kiosk. \\\"Now the vendors are pissed and retaliating.\\\"\\nThe new clashes came after a second day of voting, the first time some Egyptians -- young and old -- have ever cast ballots. Citizens are picking members of the lower house of parliament, which will be tasked with drafting a new constitution after three decades of Mubarak's rule.\\nDespite logistical problems and illegal campaigning that marred the first day of balloting on Monday, Egypt's stock exchange opened considerably higher Tuesday and saw an unprecedented wave of buying amid the elections.\\nVoters decried the late opening of polling stations Monday and a delay in the arrival of ballots, leading the head of Egypt's election committee to promise a smoother voting process Tuesday.\\nElection officials said they have received 964 complaints, 579 of which have been addressed, according to Egypt TV. State TV reported that 25 people were injured in election-related violence.\\nActivist Hafez Abu Saeeda, of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, said on Twitter he was in Al-Khaleefa \\\"working on an election tour, and an attack took place on our supporters before I arrived.\\\" The army was able to control the situation immediately, he said. One person was injured.\\nBut many voters expressed jubilation at their chance to help build a new Egypt after the popular revolt that toppled Mubarak.\\n\\\"Before, there was always cheating. Now -- I could be wrong -- but I think my vote will count,\\\" Mohamed Rida'a Mohamed Abdulla said as he left a Cairo polling station.\\nSome polling areas were segregated by gender. Lines at both men's and women's stations snaked around buildings for hours.\\n\\\"It's an awakening,\\\" one woman said, beaming, at a Cairo polling station. \\\"I'm very happy, and I feel that even when I see old ladies hardly walking, it makes me feel that really Egypt is reviving.\\\"\\nThe stakes are high for Egyptian women, who worry that if Islamists gain a majority in the lower house of Parliament, their hopes for a more liberal life will be quashed.\\nIn Alexandria, the Al Noor Salafi Muslim party and the Freedom and Justice Party accused one another of breaking an \\\"honorable agreement\\\" aimed at cooperation. The Freedom and Justice Party is part of the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, one of the nation's largest organizations.\\nYousri Hamad, a spokesman for the Al Noor Salafi party, said the Muslim Brotherhood spread false rumors and launched a \\\"smear campaign\\\" against the party.\\n\\\"We were not as prepared for the elections as we should have been and did not spend enough money on the campaigning,\\\" Hamad said.\\nBut Essam Erian, spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party, said the Salafis had breached the agreement by making such accusations without evidence.\\nAli Al Dali, an official monitor for the Egyptian Association of Human Rights, said eight cases of vote-buying had been documented in Alexandria, and police had been notified. About 45% of eligible voters in the city had cast ballots, he said.\\nElections for the lower house are scheduled to take place in three stages, based on geography. The last of the three stages is set to take place in January.\\nUpper house elections will run between January and March.\\nPresidential elections will be held by June, according to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's acting ruling body. Military leaders have said they will hand over power to a new government when one is elected, but many Egyptians say they don't trust the council and fear the military will cling to power.\\nOver the past two weeks, at least 42 people have been killed in clashes as protesters called for an immediate end to military rule. An additional 3,250 have been wounded, according to the Health Ministry.\\nSome Egyptians expressed skepticism or even boycotted the voting on Monday.\\n\\\"There is no inclination that the judiciary is independent, so there is no way to prove the election will be free and fair,\\\" said Amr Hamzawy, a 32-year-old shopkeeper.\\nCNN's Ben Wedeman, Ivan Watson, Leone Lakhani and Jim Clancy and journalists Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Ian Lee contributed to this report.\",\n          \"Despite the ray of good news in Thursday's Geneva agreement on steps to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine, President Obama was right to sound a note of caution, observing that \\\"I don't think we can be sure of anything at this point.\\\"\\nThe deal, reached by Russia, Ukraine and the West, called for, among other things, disarming illegally armed pro-Russian demonstrators in eastern Ukraine, and the surrender of the government buildings they have seized.\\nThese are good and essential first steps, but unless they can now be implemented as a basis on which the parties can move to further, bolder steps to reverse underlying trends, Ukraine could still slide into civil war. If this happened, how would it affect American national interests? Could Ukraine become a 21st century echo of the Balkans in the 1990s, when the collapse of Yugoslavia saw a decade of war between Serbs, Croatians, Bosnians and Kosovars? (No one should forget that just a century ago Ukraine was sucked into a tragic, bloody civil war shortly after gaining independence in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.)\\nThere is a saying that history never repeats itself, but it does sometimes rhyme. Fortunately, full-blown civil war in Ukraine still seems unlikely \\u2014 mainly because one side, the Ukrainian government, appears both unable and unwilling to fight.  Nonetheless, it's not hard to sketch a scenario in which war is the outcome -- and from that to envision a further scenario in which the U.S. finds itself drawn into a direct confrontation. (More on that in a moment.)\\nAs we have seen in the past two weeks in eastern Ukraine, Russian speakers\\u2014 acting either spontaneously, or at the behest of Russian security services, or both \\u2014 have taken control of government buildings in 10 cities in Ukraine's eastern provinces of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv. Ukrainian military, security and police forces are so impotent, demoralized and compromised by Russian infiltration that their response has so far been pathetic.\\nThis week, the New York Times reported on the Ukrainian government's \\\"glaring humiliation,\\\" when a military operation to confront pro-Russian militants instead saw Ukraine's 21 armored vehicles separating into two columns, surrendering or retreating.  In several instances, when confronted by pro-Russian crowds, soldiers and policemen have even switched sides.\\nIf Thursday's deal unravels and Ukrainian authorities remain unable to restore basic law and order, the pro-Russian demonstrators occupying buildings will be emboldened to expand their reach. Further steps may include the demonstrators setting up an independent \\\"republic\\\" in the three Eastern regions and seeking to drive out forces loyal to Ukraine's interim government, provoking the Kiev government to respond with greater force, and then calling in Russian troops to defend them against what they will claim to be \\\"fascists\\\" from western Ukraine.\\nResponding to a crackdown, Russian security forces would likely provide arms and other assistance to the Russian speakers, claiming that such a call for assistance from \\\"compatriots\\\" is impossible to ignore. As conflict intensifies, western Ukrainians, perhaps even Poles or other Europeans, could come to the aid of Ukraine. In this spiral, one thing could lead to the next, ending in significant bloodshed in eastern Ukraine, and perhaps even spreading beyond.\\nWidespread violence or civil war would certainly be a calamity for Ukrainians. But would its consequences for American national interests require an American military response? Fortunately for Americans, the answer is no. In 2008, when Russia crushed Georgia in a short war that ended in Russia's recognition of independence for the former Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, that was President George W Bush's answer.\\nAs the ongoing civil war in Syria has claimed more than 150,000 lives, neither President Obama nor his most ardent critics, like Arizona Sen. John McCain, have judged this such an extreme threat to U.S. interests that Americans must kill and to die to stop it.\\nThat the U.S. does not have vital national interests in Ukraine will not mean that the U.S. has no national interest in holding Moscow accountable for violating territorial integrity assurances that Russia and the U.S. gave to Ukraine in 1994 in persuading it to give up nuclear weapons. Indeed, if left to take its course, this crisis has the potential to fuel further developments that engage core American national interests.\\nFor example, if Crimea becomes Putin's precedent for creeping annexation in which Russia-instigated Russian speakers occupy government buildings, liberate a territory and establish a relationship with Russia, where will this stop? Could the 25% of the population in Latvia who are Russian speakers be tempted (or coaxed) to follow suit? (Both Latvians and Russians vividly recall that in 1940 Stalin annexed Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, nations that regained their independence only in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed.)\\nRussian military intervention in Latvia, even under the guise of special forces in green garb without insignia, would almost certainly be engaged by Latvian military and police. If Russian security forces came to the assistance of their brethren in Latvia, as they would be likely to do, this would mean a direct confrontation between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO.\\nMany Americans are not aware that Latvia and its Baltic neighbors are members of the NATO alliance, of which the United States is the leader. How many Americans know that members of that alliance, including the United States, commit themselves in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty to regard an attack against one NATO signatory as \\\"an attack against them all\\\"? Pursuant to that commitment, successive American presidents have approved war plans in which Americans would fight to defend the territory of all members of the alliance.\\nPreventing Ukraine's collapse into civil war must therefore be a high priority for the leaders of both the United States and Russia. The Geneva agreement on \\\"initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security,\\\" which U.S. and Russian diplomats signed, along with their EU and Ukrainian counterparts, represents the first real step in the international community's collective effort to reverse Ukraine's slide into chaos.\\nLeaders in both Washington and Moscow will have to follow up with further, bolder steps to prevent Ukraine's spiraling into a civil war that could draw them into a direct confrontation. These additional steps will require all parties to accept arrangements that would be unacceptable \\u2014 except for the fact that all feasible alternatives are even worse.\",\n          \"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- The European Union announced a recovery package of 180 million euros for the Ivory Coast on Tuesday as residents of the African nation attempted to adjust to life with a clear leader and relative stability after months of bloodshed.\\nForces arrested former President Laurent Gbagbo after storming his residence on Monday. Gbagbo defied calls to step down after an electoral commission declared he lost a presidential election in November to Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara has been recognized internationally as the legitimate winner.\\nA violent power struggle followed the standoff, with supporters loyal to both sides taking to the streets in protests since December. Hundreds have been killed, according to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\\nAndris Piebalgs, EU commissioner for development, announced the recovery package on Tuesday.\\n\\\"We will stand by Ivory Coast and its people by immediately starting to work with the government of President Ouattara to support him in getting the country on the right track towards reconciliation, democracy, economic recovery and sustainable development,\\\" he said.\\nThe funding will provide support to ensure basic needs for citizens such as health, water, sanitation and to support the agricultural sector, Piebalgs said in a statement. It also will clear the Ivory Coast's debt accumulated through the European Investment Bank.\\nTop military brass pledged their support to Ouattara in a ceremony Tuesday at a hotel in Abdijan. Gen. Phillipe Mangou, Gbagbo's former army chief of staff, said on state television that the generals were received by Ouattara and given orders to take measures to restore order in the country.\\nAll security personnel should rejoin their posts Wednesday morning, Mangou said, to help the country return to normal. He also appealed to citizens who participated in the unrest to lay down their weapons and return to work, saying that those who fail to do so will be considered outlaws.\\nThe United Nations' World Food Programme said it was planning airlifts in the coming days \\\"to provide life-saving food assistance to tens of thousands of internally displaced people\\\" in Ivory Coast, as well as Ivorian refugees in neighboring Liberia.\\n\\\"We need to open up a humanitarian lifeline to the many Ivorians who are now the victims of alarming shortages of food, water and other basic needs,\\\" said Josette Sheeran, World Food Programme executive director. The organization will airlift food from Niger and Mali into western Ivory Coast and Monrovia, Liberia, as part of a plan to transport 15,000 metric tons of cereals, vegetable oil and other items, it said in a statement.\\nU.S. President Barack Obama called Ouattara on Tuesday \\\"to congratulate him on assuming his duties as the democratically elected president,\\\" the White House said in a statement. Obama offered Ouattara support in his efforts to unite the nation, restore security and the economy and reform the security forces, the statement said.\\nIn addition, \\\"the two leaders ... reiterated the importance of ensuring that alleged atrocities are investigated and that perpetrators -- regardless of which side they supported -- are held accountable for their actions\\\" in Ivory Coast, the White House said. The two also committed to support the United Nations commission of inquiry and the International Criminal Court in investigating abuses.\\nGbagbo rejected an offer to teach at an American university and have supporters in Ouattara's cabinet, as well as immunity from International Criminal Court prosecution, an African diplomat with knowledge of the situation told CNN Tuesday.\\nGbagbo had only 200 troops left and no way to restock the basement refuge of the presidential palace when he was captured, the source said, declining to be named discussing sensitive details.\\nThe Ivorian forces who stormed Gbagbo's residence could simply have thrown a grenade into the basement, but Ouattara had given specific instructions that he was not to be killed, the source said.\\n\\\"Finally, we have reached the dawn of a new era of hope,\\\" Ouattara said in a televised address Monday. \\\"We had hoped this transfer had been different, but we have to focus on today.\\\"\\nOuattara said he would set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate allegations of human rights violations.\\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed Ouattara's plan for the commission, according to a statement from his spokesperson. In a phone call with Ouattara on Monday, Ban underlined the expectation that any further bloodshed will be avoided now that Gbagbo is in the hands of Ouattara's forces.\\n\\\"The Secretary-General calls on all parties to work together to put an end to this tragic chapter, which could have been avoided had Mr. Gbagbo respected the will of the people at a far earlier stage,\\\" according to the statement.\\nOuattara urged his countrymen to lay down their weapons and said he has asked the justice minister to start legal proceedings against Gbagbo, his wife and his colleagues.\\nGbagbo was being held at the Golf Hotel, which has served as Ouattara's headquarters during the turmoil. Ouattara's government remains responsible for Gbagbo's physical safety, according to the U.N. statement.\\nGbagbo asked for and is receiving U.N. protection, according to Alain Le Roy, under-secretary-general of the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Le Roy said forces are also ensuring the security of the former leader's wife.\\n\\\"I understand from President Ouattara that he wants President Gbagbo to go on trial in Ivory Coast,\\\" said the U.N. official.\\nFighting largely ended soon after Gbagbo's arrest, Le Roy said.\\n\\\"To my knowledge, most of the fighting has stopped,\\\" he said, adding that \\\"there are pockets of resistance here and there.\\\"\\nLe Roy -- along with the Ivory Coast's ambassador to the United Nations, Youssoufou Bamba, and the French Embassy -- said forces loyal to Ouattara made the arrest.\\nAuthorities are trying to move carefully and follow legal procedures to bring Gbagbo to trial, said a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the events. The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.\\nThe arrest is a \\\"step in the right direction to return Ivory Coast to normality,\\\" the source said, adding that the city of Abidjan is a wreck, with \\\"death squads, militias roaming (and) burning bodies on the streets, which is posing a major humanitarian challenge.\\\"\\nThe fighting left Abidjan with sporadic power and sanitation, and residents said dead bodies were left on the streets.\\nEven after Gbagbo's arrest, Abidjan looked like a ghost city, with few venturing outside after all the violence. Parts of the city were still grappling with food and water shortages on Tuesday, but some signs of normalcy surfaced as traffic flowed on the streets.\\nSpeaking from inside the Golf Hotel, Gbagbo told his supporters to stop fighting.\\n\\\"I hope that people lay down their weapons and return to a normal state of civil rule so that the crisis can conclude as quickly as possible,\\\" he said.\\nKenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who served as the African Union's main negotiator in Ivory Coast, said he hopes Ouattara will be merciful as president.\\n\\\"Gbagbo's capture should be a lesson to African leaders to respect the will of the people as expressed in the ballot,\\\" he said. \\\"I urge President Ouattara to be magnanimous in victory and grant him and his people amnesty.\\\" Ouattara should also exercise inclusivity in the formation of his government, Odinga said.\\nAt least tens of thousands of people have fled into neighboring Liberia to escape the fighting, according to Oxfam, an international aid organization.\\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said that 800 people had been shot dead in the western cocoa-producing town of Duekoue during the conflict. A U.N. official put the death toll at 330.\\nBan predicted last week that the outcome of the crisis in Ivory Coast would set the tone for other nations in Africa.\\n\\\"What happens in Cote d'Ivoire has huge implications for the continent that will have 16 presidential elections this year,\\\" he said, using the French name for the country.\\nCNN's Dan Rivers, Jack Maddox, Sarita Harilela, Carol
